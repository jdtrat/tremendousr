listing available payment types, funding sources, account members, and
more. See the \href{https://developers.tremendous.com/}{Tremendous API Documentation} for examples.}

details.}

\item{body}{Request body for Tremendous API, as an R List.}

\item{disk}{A path to write to. \code{NULL} by default, so info is written to
memory. See \link[crul:HttpClient]{crul::HttpClient} for more details.}

\item{stream}{An R function to determine how to stream data. \code{NULL} by
default, so info is streaned with memory. See \link[crul:HttpClient]{crul::HttpClient} for more
details.}

\item{encode}{"json" by default based on Tremendous API Request format. See
\link[crul:HttpClient]{crul::HttpClient} for more options.}

}
\description{
This function provides lower-level access to perform POST
requests via Tremendous API. Available endpoints can be found on the
official \href{https://developers.tremendous.com/}{Tremendous API documentation}.

For sending payments, I would recommend using \code{\link{trem_send_reward}} as
it's more intuitive to use. However, this can be done using the
\code{trem_post()} function (see examples).
